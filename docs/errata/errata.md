# Page x - Writing code using VS Code

I wrote, "VS Code has an improved project creation experience that provides you access to the same options you can use when creating a new project through the `dotnet` CLI. To enable this ability, you must change a setting, as shown in the following configuration:"
```
"csharp.experimental.dotnetNewIntegration": true
```

This feature is no longer in preview so you do not need to enable it. In the next edition, I will remove the sentence about enabling it and the setting.

In Step 3, I wrote, "In `Program.cs`, before the call to `Build`, in the section for configuring services, register the hybrid cache service..."

Unfortunately, even after the release of .NET 9 on November 12, 2024, the `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Hybrid` package is still in preview, and the `AddHybridCache` method call causes a compiler warning. Until the package is released as GA, you will need to surround the call with a temporary warning suppression, as shown in the following code:
```cs
#pragma warning disable EXTEXP0018 // Type is for evaluation purposes only and is subject to change or removal in future updates. Suppress this diagnostic to proceed.
builder.Services.AddHybridCache(options =>
{
  options.DefaultEntryOptions = new HybridCacheEntryOptions
  {
    Expiration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60),
    LocalCacheExpiration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)
  };
});
#pragma warning restore EXTEXP0018 // Type is for evaluation purposes only and is subject to change or removal in future updates. Suppress this diagnostic to proceed.
```

# Exercise 13.2 – practice exercises - Build web pages for functions

This exercise should have been in *Chapter 14 Building Interactive Web Components Using Blazor*, because it is much easier to implement using interactive Blazor features rather than the limited Blazor static server-side rendering (SSR).

Updated functions page to use server-side interactivity:
https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/code/ModernWeb/Northwind.Blazor/Northwind.Blazor/Components/Pages/Functions.razor

Updated navmenu to include link to functions page:
https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/code/ModernWeb/Northwind.Blazor/Northwind.Blazor/Components/Layout/NavMenu.razor
